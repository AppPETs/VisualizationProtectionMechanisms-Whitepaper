# Demonstration of Privacy Protection Mechanisms for Document Storage Services

As privacy protection mechanisms are not necessarily visible to the user it is hard to demonstrate their effectiveness. We present several visualizations, which can be used for that purpose.


For the document storage service, see [PrivacyService](https://github.com/AppPETs/PrivacyService).

## Compilation

The article can be compiled by running:

```sh
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
make
```

There are also compiled PDF files in the releases section [[Download PDF](https://github.com/AppPETs/VisualizationProtectionMechanisms-Whitepaper/releases/download/v1.0.0/VisualizationProtectionMechanisms-Whitepaper-v1.0.0.pdf)].
